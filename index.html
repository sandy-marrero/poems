        <p>
            I am Sandy Marrero, a Software Engineering student. Art has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I wrote these poems 4 years ago, at the start of the COVID pandemic. This poems are an encapsulation of all that I felt, saw and thought.

            Hope you enjoy, feel and relate to them as much as I do.

        <h2 class="poem-title">The 3AM Duet</h2>
        <p>
A gloom follows me around, taking
turns with storms to make my
thoughts fly by. All they do is faking
I’m miserable. Just fine I’m getting by.

They follow as a couple, destined to
wreck havoc. I take out my bag and
bring out my greatest weapon, my
phone. As if allergic they vanish.

Silently the night arrives and so
they do. It’s 3AM, they crawl into my
ears, “you are horrible,” “you deserve no one,” “you are a terrible person”. 
The quotation ticks don’t leave my side, slowly growing as insecurities exude out of my pores.

I’m changing, my confident self is
being taken hostage and what’s left
is a child afraid of living. A child
infested with insecurities, incapable of handling the world.

    <section class="poem">
        <h2 class="poem-title">The New Life</h2>
        <p>
Sometimes life gets too monotonous,
as I wish I could turn the tide around.
Too deep into it I notice, seems like my life sails itself
into oblivion.

A shipwreck is what I need, to take
the mantle of captain of my ship.
However a new sail I got to make
Made out of strong will, capable
of sailing through the hardest of life.

    <section class="poem">
        <h2 class="poem-title">Empty</h2>
        <p>
A reflection of what’s behind is
what I see in my chest, to the left.
A void into sadness, which doesn’t
discriminate, taking all of you, it is a
theft. You can’t help but hide it but
it digs deeper into what’s left. No
choice to keep going, he is one day
leaving, either with or without me. He is me.

    <section class="poem">
        <h2 class="poem-title">Letter to my future self</h2>
        <p>
Don’t be so hard on yourself,
You are being your best self.
Life is not easy, but you have
What it takes to keep thriving.

Hopefully you will achieve your dreams,
That professional you always wanted to be.
Giving back to your family for their sacrifices,
Giving back to the world for pushing you harder.

Your past self looks up to you,
It’s up to you to make him proud.
You are more capable than you think,
Your experiences made you stronger.

Cheers to the future,
Cheers to my future self, Sandy

        <h2 class="poem-title">First Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
I opened my eyes to a new world,
Right in the middle of the living room.
My life appeared to had started as I
Could not recognize anything around me.

A nice lady arrives and finds me,
I could not help but wonder who she was.
My mother is what she said, seems like
alone I am not. Maybe I started living,
Or I forgot everything. A dream could it be?
I will never know, but these are my first memories.
